# Youth and Time

## Beginnings

before 18 I wrote epistles  
treatises on life and thought  
after 18 I grew in cycles  
above the wars I fought

by a quarter dozen years after  
I had learnt the tune  
of Solomon's song of vanity  
and near the ocean did dream bright

## First phase

half a sun dance  
before I learnt to code  
I started arranging my words  
[poetrique](https://poetrique.github.io/archives/), I called it

a palace of dreams and contemplation  
I wrote in many names  
\`changing ... as the wind blew\`  
I danced in many flames

## Love is war

the first hue I kissed was **Red**  
a beautiful soul  
with skin like the hands of time  
she liked the colour of my mind

[I was pained when it ended](https://ilovedred.netlify.app/).  
a fortnight of bliss and changes,  
a lifetime of scars, unbandaged  
she taught me love

> & that it was war

## Dimensions

1. Digital art
1. Software engineering
1. Poetry and her friends

all above I dine with  
each night when I dream of glory

## The schema

\`\`\`
moving forward
I will keep the lane of focus
at hand, and in sight

have all else dance along,
until of self-accord
a union in roads is formed.
A king must stay strong
\`\`\`
